# ⚓ Webhook exercise

Developed during Internet technologies 2020/21L course at Adam Mickiewicz University.  

## 🎯 Task's aim

> Create and deploy an application that consumes a git webhook and through this mechanism is able to restart another application after a push to its GIT repository. This should give automatic updates of the application. Webhooks are supported by both GitHub and our git.wmi.amu.edu.pl. Create a repository and integrate with your application to show that it works. Make sure to check HMAC signature that is present in the webhook.
